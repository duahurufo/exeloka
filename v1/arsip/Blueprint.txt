PETRONAS — Sampang Social‑License Copilot
Blueprint & Pilot Plan
Date: September 05, 2025  |  Location: East Java (Sampang)
 
1) Executive Summary
AHA in one line: We don’t slip because of engineering; we slip because of people. This copilot turns Sampang’s unwritten rules into a timed, scripted playbook—who to call, what to say, when to go—cutting unplanned nearshore standby and escalations, and leaving an audit-ready trail.
Business case in plain terms:
• Reduce unplanned standby hours tied to coastal/community interactions
• Speed up endorsements/approvals for nearshore work windows
• Standardize contractor interactions to the PETRONAS way
• Produce attachable evidence for audits and incident close-outs
Pilot commitment:
• Scope one nearshore/landfall-adjacent campaign touching Sampang (6–8 weeks)
• Success gate: ≥25% reduction in standby hours + strong stakeholder score → scale
2) Problem — Felt Pain
• Invisible social risk: fishing seasons, religious calendars, informal leadership chains aren’t in Primavera—so we plan in the dark and apologize later.
• Tribal know‑how: what works with specific leaders lives in heads and WhatsApp; rotations force costly relearning.
• Contractor roulette: one master gets it right, the next sparks a complaint → inconsistency triggers standbys.
• Reactive comms: we communicate after friction, not before it—burning vessel hours and goodwill.
• No proof of ‘doing it right’: sequence, phrasing, and sign‑offs aren’t captured in an audit‑friendly way.
3) The Solution — Social‑License Copilot (Sampang)
What it is: a place‑specific decision support that converts local wisdom into clear, timed, and scripted moves.
Core outputs:
• Stakeholder sequence & timing (who to inform first, in what order)
• Talk tracks (do/don’t phrasing; apology/closure templates)
• No‑work windows (events, prayer times, local ceremonies) mapped to plans
• Two‑speed guidance: quick rules for planners/masters; deeper guidance for sensitive cases
• Audit‑ready trail of checks and engagements
Guiding principles:
• Depth over breadth (Sampang‑tuned, not generic)
• Frontline‑first (answers in under 2 minutes)
• Augments human judgment; does not replace it
• Neutral and multi‑voice (not captured by any one faction)
4) Unique Value Proposition
• From advice to schedule: “Tuesday 16:00: call A → then B; use this phrasing; avoid these hours.”
• Language that lands: local tone and titles that open doors, not defenses.
• Operational fit: built for planners, masters, shorebase, and public affairs—usable in <2 minutes.
• Defensible record: attachable evidence for permits and close‑outs.
5) PETRONAS’ Unfair Advantage
• We own the context: marine schedules + coastal touchpoints let us predict friction windows better than outsiders.
• Standardization power: one playbook makes every contractor interact the PETRONAS way—reducing roulette.
• Trust stays inside: sensitive local intelligence remains ours, not a vendor’s case study.
• Legitimacy on day one: co‑create with respected local voices we already engage.
6) Why Now
• East Java activity rising; Sampang touchpoints increasing.
• Standby hours are costly; post‑incident scrutiny is higher.
• Faster rotations → need a single source of truth to prevent repeat mistakes.
7) Where It Helps in the Upstream Value Chain
Exploration (seismic, geotech, site surveys): map fishing seasons/grounds and taboos to timing windows; who to inform and in what order; compensation framings for gear conflicts.
Drilling & construction (nearshore landfalls, logistics): stakeholder routing (village heads → religious leaders → fishers’ reps) with do/don’t phrasing; community calendar overlays for no‑work windows.
Operations (marine traffic, maintenance): notice‑to‑mariners style comms in local tone; quick triggers that cause friction; apology/closure templates.
CSR & local content: programs communities actually value, fronted by the right messengers.
8) Pilot Plan 
Scope: one nearshore/landfall‑adjacent campaign touching Sampang.
Deliverables:
1) Stakeholder sequence & timing (who/when/how)
2) Marine etiquette pack for masters (10 rules; five phrases to use/avoid)
3) Incident apology/closure templates
4) Lightweight action dashboard (what was checked, who was engaged, when)
Roles: Sponsor (Ops + Public Affairs), Delivery (shorebase lead + PA focal + master rep), Advisory (plural local voices).
Decision gate: achieve ≥25% standby reduction + strong stakeholder score → standardize across East Java.
9) Success Metrics & ROI Model
Primary KPIs:
• Unplanned standby hours linked to coastal/community interactions (target −30–50%)
• Escalations/complaints requiring management time (target −50%)
• Endorsement cycle time (request → green‑light) (faster)
• Audit readiness (clean, attachable trail)
ROI formula:
Savings = (Standby hours avoided) × (Blended day rate of affected assets) + (Manager hours avoided × cost/hour) + (Schedule risk reduction in $ terms)

Other quantifiable impacts		
Worked example (fill with real numbers):
• Last landfall maintenance: 36 standby hours due to coastal friction.
• With copilot: 18 hours. Reduction = 18 hours.
• Estimated savings = 18 × [blended day rate]. Add management hours avoided and faster endorsement value.
10) Adoption & Change Management
• Two‑minute answers: concise outputs for frontline users; no long manuals.
• Fold into existing checklists (planning, marine notices, PA briefings).
• Contractor onboarding: standardize ‘the PETRONAS way’ in kickoff packs.
• Feedback loop: quick capture of what worked/what didn’t to improve guidance.
11) Governance & Content Legitimacy
• Plural local voices: co‑create and review with respected representatives (avoid single‑faction bias).
• Review cadence: quarterly refresh; event/leadership change triggers interim updates.
• Provenance: cite sources internally; log who approved changes and when.
• Boundaries: decision support, not decision replacement.
12) Key Risks & Mitigations
• Tokenism → Co‑creation with multiple local voices; show how guidance changed decisions.
• Perceived bias → Multi‑party advisory inputs; transparent internal citations.
• Over‑reliance → Clear positioning and training that human judgment leads.
• Change fatigue → Keep it pragmatic; embed in existing workflows.
13) Internal Competition Rubric — How We Score High
Impact: Money & schedule first (−30–50% standby; faster endorsements).
Strategic fit: Safeguards social license for offshore ops; template for replication.
Feasibility: Codifies and standardizes existing know‑how; low‑drama pilot.
Differentiation: From advice to schedule; audit‑ready trail; two‑minute answers.
Story: One crisp before/after story with planner/master quote.
14) Narrative & Script
30‑second script:
“Every quarter we burn vessel hours not to engineering, but to coastal interactions we didn’t schedule. This Sampang copilot turns local unwritten rules into a timed playbook—who to call, what to say, when to go—cutting unplanned standby and escalations, and leaving an audit‑ready trail. We’ll prove it on the next nearshore window; if we don’t show a double‑digit standby reduction, we don’t scale it.”
Taglines:
• Plan once. Speak right. Move faster.
• Local wisdom, operationalized.
• From ‘hope it’s fine’ to ‘we scheduled it.’
